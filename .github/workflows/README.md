## ðŸ”§ Configuration Requirements

### GitHub Secrets

The workflows require the following secrets to be configured:

**Production Environment**:

- `PRODUCTION_API_URL`: Production API endpoint
- `PRODUCTION_DB_HOST`: Production database host
- `PRODUCTION_REDIS_URL`: Production Redis connection

**Staging Environment**:

- `STAGING_API_URL`: Staging API endpoint
- `STAGING_DB_HOST`: Staging database host
- `STAGING_REDIS_URL`: Staging Redis connection

**Database Backups**:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: S3 access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: S3 secret key
- `S3_BACKUP_BUCKET`: S3 bucket for backups

**Health Monitoring**:

- `HEALTH_CHECK_EMAIL`: Test user email
- `HEALTH_CHECK_PASSWORD`: Test user password

**Deployment**:

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Docker Hub password

### Environment Protection Rules

Configure GitHub environment protection rules:

1. **Staging Environment**:

   - Required reviewers: Development team
   - Deployment branches: main, develop

2. **Production Environment**:
   - Required reviewers: Senior developers + DevOps
   - Deployment branches: main only
   - Wait timer: 5 minutes

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Integration

### Dependency Relationships

```
CI/CD Pipeline
â”œâ”€â”€ Triggers Security Scanning
â”œâ”€â”€ Uses Documentation Generation
â””â”€â”€ Integrates with Release Management

Security Scanning
â”œâ”€â”€ Feeds into CI/CD Pipeline
â””â”€â”€ Blocks releases on critical issues

Monitoring
â”œâ”€â”€ Validates CI/CD Deployments
â””â”€â”€ Triggers Health Alerts

Release Management
â”œâ”€â”€ Requires CI/CD Success
â”œâ”€â”€ Uses Documentation Updates
â””â”€â”€ Triggers Production Monitoring
```

### Artifact Flow

- **CI/CD**: Produces Docker images, test reports, coverage reports
- **Security**: Generates SARIF files, vulnerability reports
- **Documentation**: Creates API docs, schema docs, Postman collections
- **Release**: Bundles all artifacts into release packages

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Initial Setup

1. Configure all required GitHub secrets
2. Set up environment protection rules
3. Configure branch protection rules
4. Enable GitHub Pages for documentation
5. Set up S3 bucket for backups

### First Deployment

1. Push code to develop branch (triggers CI/CD)
